Q: What guarantees does the platform provide?
A: Deterministic orchestration, typed I/O, schema validation, inline citations, and explicit insufficient-context fallback.

Q: How do we measure performance?
A: Prometheus metrics for latency histograms and grounded ratio; an offline eval harness produces an HTML report.

Q: Is the system fast enough for live calls?
A: For a small knowledge base the p95 latency should be under 3 seconds with grounded answers.
